# Phishing Detector - Readme File

## Project Overview
This is a phishing detection tool designed to identify and classify potentially malicious URLs that may be attempting phishing attacks. The system uses machine learning techniques to analyze website characteristics and determine their legitimacy.

## Features
- URL analysis for phishing indicators
- Machine learning-based classification
- Real-time detection capabilities
- User-friendly interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbaidya811/Phishing-Detector.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
